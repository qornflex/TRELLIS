## TrellisMatGen
This repo is a combination of 2 forks:
- TRELLIS (https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS)
- Map Generator (https://github.com/joeyballentine/Material-Map-Generator)

The repo contains an automated installer (install.bat) which makes the process much easier.

The repo also contains a bunch of scripts (qfx) to be used with [QFXMeshify](https://quentinlengele.com/index.php/2025/10/20/qfxmeshify/) Unreal Plugin.
